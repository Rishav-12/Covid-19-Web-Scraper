# Covid-19-Web-Scraper
Scrape Covid-19 related data from a website

### Description
* This script, on being started, runs in the background
* It scrapes the website *https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/* to collect information about a given country's covid data
* I set the country to India, but you can definitely change that to your country
